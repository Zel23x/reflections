When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

  When using another device for working on my project or for allowing other to add stuff to my work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If repo is public, then i can choose which commit to update on my local repo. That way i don't alter my work so deliverately.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is for cloning a other's github repos into my own github account within just github. Clone is for cloning others or self repos it could be locally or remotely, branches is for logically differentiate a commit from your master branch, this way commits done on one branch do not affect the other unless they're merged.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    The benefit is beign able to decide if changes/additions made by other on your code can be implemented on your main branch without altering your current work. That way we can have a more robust main branch.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Well, by searching a forum and requesting aid from another user. Although communicating with him through other medium makes it quite hard to update and compare the work done by each of us. Also, the collaboration would be limited to who i've decided to mantain communication with.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
